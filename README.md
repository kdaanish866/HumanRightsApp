# HumanRightsApp

Web application to display rights/recommendations for specific situations with police. Used to protect your rights in hostile situations
Allows citizens to search reviews of police officers to help them ascertain whether to avoid or approach such law enforcement. Individuals, particularly marginalized communities, can then see officersâ€™ ratings and judge them anonymously for their own safety. Police Officers themselves can register for their own profile and review their ratings, hopefully so they gain insight into how well they perform at their job for the sake of the greater society.

Front end: Responsive landing page to register as a police officer with name, badge number and headshot, or to submit a review on a police officer by entering badge number and name. 
Back end: Stores all police officer objects by name and badge number, along with a unique randomized identifier.
